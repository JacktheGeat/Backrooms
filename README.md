# Backrooms datapack

no natural way to get in there. You have to use /execute in backrooms:level_0 run tp @s ~ -61 ~

Currently I removed the entity-bacterium room from generation. I don't know why but increasing the size of the template pool slows the world generation to a literal crawl, and nobody wants to fight an army of powered up wither skeletons. 
If anyone reading this has any suggestions to fix this i would love to hear it.
